# GO-AWS-course

A compact, practical companion for a comprehensive Go masterclass focused on building real-world, production-grade systems. This repository contains the course source code and exercises that teach modern Go development, cloud integrations (AWS), concurrency, testing, Docker workflows, and clean architecture.

## Overview

This course is a hands-on, project-driven path from beginner to advanced Go engineer. Instead of toy examples, you build production-ready REST and GraphQL services, learn scalable concurrency patterns, and implement real cloud integrations (S3, SQS). The material emphasizes testability, maintainability, and shipping code using Docker and microservices principles.

## What You’ll Learn

- Build production-ready REST and GraphQL APIs with JWT authentication and clean architecture.
- Master Go concurrency with goroutines, channels, and synchronization for high-throughput systems.
- Containerize and deploy services with Docker and Docker Compose, preparing apps for microservices.
- Write robust tests: unit tests, integration tests, and use advanced mocking techniques.
- Integrate with AWS services (S3, SQS) and mock them locally with LocalStack.
- Implement advanced systems like an MCP server to prepare A.I.-ready tooling.
- Work with databases (SQLite, Postgres) using raw SQL and gORM, including Postgres full-text search.
- Use modern Go features: generics, modules, and the `embed` directive.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (variables, loops, functions).
- Familiarity with the command line is helpful.
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Go 1.24+ (installation covered in course).
- VS Code or GoLand (optional), Docker Desktop, and Git.

## Who This Is For

- Backend and frontend engineers learning modern Go.
- Developers transitioning from other languages (Java, Python, JS, C#, PHP).
- Students and professionals who want project-based, career-ready Go skills.

## Notes

The repository contains full source code and exercises used in the course. The course is actively maintained and may receive updates to keep content current.
